# The Diamond In The Rough: Angular

**Important note: This repo is no longer public. App is being changed to have both a front end and the backend repository. Please email me if you are a recruiter or employer wishing to see my work. I will be willing to grant access to those seeking my services.**

This is the Angular 8 fullstack version of my website which will be the upgrade for.

Its about 62% of the way complete. It runs so long as you have `mongodb`.

We are using `TypeScript` both frontend and backend. However, it will not work in this repo, so it will be running using a js stack.

First clone this repo. Before taking futher steps, make sure you have `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Then run `npm install` to install all required `node_modules`.

All modules a stored in `node_modules` and `webpack` is used as a module loader.  

Make sure you have `mongodb` installed. Open another terminal tab and create the desired name for your database using **Mongo Shell**. Run the command `mongo` to open the shell and run the `use "DATABASE_NAME"` to create your desired database.
 
For easier access use something like `Robo3T`or something similar. Command line control of `mongo` is also an option, but is not covered by this readme.

Once finished, then and only then, can you run `npm start`.

Navigate to `localhost:5000` and you should be there.
